# Risk

## Zero to one


The main point of the book is that the future is not in globalisation, but in technology.
Globalisation means repeating what already works (going from 1 to n) while technology means creating new things (0 to 1).
Globalisation increases competition, which drives down profits and makes things closer to a zero sum game, technology does the opposite.
Competition is "destructive" in that sense.

I do agree that (creative) monopolies are great for creating new value to humanity -
they can afford to spend resources on improving their product, creating a culture, effecting change.
Competitive businesses live on low margins and have a miserable existence, rarely creating anything new to society.

I do think though that competition is important to make things better for everyone (as opposed to a few people), even if it doesn't create anything drastically new.

## Why we focus on competition

The book argues that the world has seen an unprecedented period of increasing wealth and progress (50s, 60s and 80s)
which makes western society adopt an "indefinite optimist" attitude -
the future will be better, but we don't know how, so we won't plan for it (and thus won't build it).

In Europe we have indefinite pessimism - things will never be as good as they were,
and we have no idea what's coming but it will be worse.

In Thiel's opinion:

> We exaggerate the differences between left-liberal egalitarianism and libertarian individualism because almost everyone shares their common indefinite attitude.
> In philosophy, politics, and business, too, arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making concrete plans for a better future.

We attribute success to luck and circumstances - and we are suspicious of people with grand plans,
they're either crackpots or corrupt and insincere.
This indefinite optimism leads to the focus on competition in business.

## How to go from Zero to One

The best way to build a (creative) monopoly is to start with a small, niche market and then scale up to adjacent markets -
like how Amazon started with rare books and eBay with beanie babies.
If you go for 1% of a $100bi market you'll be quickly competed away.

This is the most important question that the founder of a company has to answer:

> What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

The answer to this question is necessarily a secret: a truth about the world that no one else knows. Some examples of secrets:

- Tesla: cleantech is a social phenomenon not an environmental one
- Airbnb: guests have to pay high hotel prices, property owners can't easily rent out their unoccupied space (similar for Uber, Lyft)
- Google: proprietary indexing and searching 10x better than anything else
- Apple: proprietary technology and design 10x better than anything else
- PayPal: beanie baby eBay sellers had no easy way to transfer money
- Amazon: no easy way to find rare books

We are discouraged from looking for secrets because we were taught that there are no more existing secrets:
everything is either easy/known or impossible/unknowable.

## Laws of trading


1. Know why you're doing a trade before you trade

2. You're never happy with the amount you traded (adverse selection)

Specialize

3. Take only the risks you're being paid to take. Hedge the others.

Self financing portfolio - account for opportunity cost

Collateral - real reason that trading costs money

Goodhart's law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

Use multiple measures of risk

Market making without an edge (buying bid and selling ask) is equivalent to selling options.

Explanation: to hedge an option you can sell when market moves up, buy when moves down (delta hedging).

Plus, hedging a long option is equivalent to selling an option.

Therefore, delta hedging without buying a long option is equivalent to selling an optio

4. Put on a risk using the most liquid instrument for that risk

5. If you can't explain your edge in five minutes, you don't have a very good one

Edge = what you know about the world and what you can do about it that the marginal trader can't

A good edge needs some, but not too much: creativity, persistence, quantitative review,

6. The model expresses the edge

7. If you think your costs are negligible relative to your edge, you're wrong about at least one of them

Costs can be understood in terms of their visibility and their linearity (how they scale)

E.g. even if a strategy/model makes a profit a majority of the times, if competition is so high that you can only get in 10% of the trades (low "hit rate"), your edge will get eaten away and adverse selection ensures you'll mostly get in the bad trades!

8. Just because something has never happened it doesn't mean it can't.

Enough people relying on something being true makes it false

Eg. Reliance on chf euro peg, US short sale ban in 2008, reliance on low correlation within US mortgage securities as a cause for 2008 crisis

9. working to align everyone's interests is time well spent

Hedge funds often don't have aligned interests between investors and managers: managers make more money under a high variance strategy. Even if you penalize them for losses (high water marks) it's still more worth to close shop if there are huge losses.

Same with real estate agents: it's more worth to convince a client to take a high offer than to work for months to get a better offer since the more houses they turn the better for them.

The only way to align incentives is to have the traders keep enough of their own capital in the firm, or build the pay structure to reflect this alignment.

10. If you don't master technology and data, you're losing to someone who does

11. If you’re not getting better, you’re getting worse

The goal of trading is to make sustainable profits. There is an analogy with evolution in biology.

Given a source of variation in the characteristics of organisms, which result in different reproductive fitness, natural selection is the mechanism by which less fit individuals die, and more fit (better adapted) individuals reproduce and pass on their characteristics.

The sources of variation in financial markets come in the form of new ideas, applying existing trades to new markets, combining two trades. “Reproduction” occurs in the specific ways that knowledge gets shared in financial markets: individuals learn new skills and split up and gather in new groups, just like firms split and merge.

Surviving and thriving in financial markets requires adaptation - improvement.

One of the most important sources of motivation for personal improvement, more than money and prestige, is a 6th sense about things that don't make sense, aren't quite right, “feel a bit off” or don't quite “fit”.

## The black swan

Our world is dominated by the extreme, the unknown, and the very improbable according to our current knowledge - and we spend our time focusing on the known and the repeated.
The future will be increasingly less predictable because of our progress and growth in knowledge

Physical matters like size, calorie consumption follow normal distributions where extreme events are unlikely and don't affect any sample mean.

Social matters like wealth, media references, sold book copies follow fat tailed distributions where extreme events have a disproportionate effect on sample means.

Black swan, or problem of induction, is the difficulty in generalising from available information
"all swans are white"
Seeing 1000 white swans cannot prove you right. Seeing 1 black swan proves you wrong.

"The cosmetic and the platonic rise to the surface"

That's why we are subject to selection bias, confirmation bias, narrative bias. It's why we depend on incorrect models of uncertainty and have black swans

We can get negative confirmation from history, but never theorize and derive general knowledge.
Learn to read history, get all the knowledge you can, but do not draw any causal links.

Rank beliefs not according to their plausibility but by the harm they may cause

So what can we do?
For small matters, accept the human tendency to belief an prediction, and make your forecasts (is it gonna rain in the picnic tomorrow?)
For large matters, insure yourself agains negative black swans, expose yourself to positive.
Use a barbell strategy: if you know you're vulnerable to prediction errors, be as hyper conservative and hyperaggressive as you can.
Instead of investing in "medium risk" investments, put a huge portion of your portfolio in extremely safe instruments, and the rest in small, extremely speculative bets (as many as you can).
Or have a speculative portfolio but insure it against losses of more than e.g. 15%. The important thing is to clip the losses from a black swan.

Negative black swan businesses: face only downside. Military. Banking (collecting pennies in front of a steamroller)
Positive: movies, publishing, scientific research, VC

"When you have a very limited loss, you need to get as aggressive, as speculative, and sometimes as unreasonable as you can be"

In extremistan, outcomes cannot be compared to a "lottery ticket" - in a lottery the payoff distribution is well understood, of known limit.
The odds of a black swan are impossible to compute, but we can ascertain the consequences and make decisions around it.

In a normal distribution, as you double the variable the odds scale exponentially fast.
In a power law distribution, as you double the variable the odds half, or divide by 4 or a different number (determined by the exponent) this causes much fatter tails.

The exponent of a power law distribution can never be precisely known, as the rarer events will always be undersampled.
But the distribution implies that the top few % of the variable concentrate the majority of the distribution (80/20 rule).

80/20 rule
"80% of outcomes are due to 20% of causes"

Let P(x) be a power-law distribution over a variable x and we choose a threshold t for what we consider to be a large x.
Then the probability of finding x>t  of the maximum is 0.2.

For example, suppose we have 10 salespeople who sold 100 products.
If x is number of products sold per salesperson and P(x) follows a power law, then we might find that P(x>40) = 0.2, that is, 2 of the salespeople sold over 40 products each, totalling a number above 2*40/100 = 80% of sales.

So the exact 80/20 rule comes from carefully choosing the threshold, but the general asymmetric relation holds for any threshold

Software engineering
Data science
Biology
Economy
History
Psychology
Design
are all empirical science

In the absence of certainty, nature favours redundancy and adaptability as opposed to specialisation

In extremistan, we're not necessarily underestimating the probability of a low likelihood mediocristan event, but we might be underestimating the severity of a fat-tails low-probability event. Fat tails can mean higher probability of extreme events, but it can also mean the presence of events that are more extreme

To avoid the risk of black swan events, you should avoid situations from extremistan where there's a variable (negative) payoff.
The best you can do in these situations is making them into a binary outcome, for example by limiting your exposure
If you can't cut your exposure, respect the time tested things that have been working for a long time.
Prefer robustness and redundancy over optimisation.
Avoid risk metrics - they always rely on concepts from mediocristan (even outside gaussian assumptions).
