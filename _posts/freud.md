The two foundational hypotheses of Freud's psychoanalysis are

1. Mental processes (drivers of behaviour, will and thought) are unconscious, only a small fraction of them being conscious
2. Mental diseases are largely cause by sexual impulses

For Freud, faulty acts like slips of tongue are not chance events or symptoms of a distracted mind. 
He puts forward some arguments for why such an explanation would not account for all cases.
Instead, he believes that they have a purpose or intention.

One of the first examples that Freud uses is an instance where the president of the lower house of parliament says in his opening speech 
"I declare the sitting **closed**".

**Assuming** that faulty acts **do** have an intention, it's clear (just taking it literally), that he wanted to close the session.

How can we know what is the intention of the faulty act? 
The intended meaning is clear as the speaker will always correct himself. 
The only way to know what the intention of the faulty act was is to ask the speaker. 
If he says what first comes to mind, you will have your answer. 
He might though be tempted to resist, and this will be easy to notice and will point to the path for the interpretation.

He conceded that that's an imperfect way of inferring the true intention, but it it's the best available to us external observers - 
Freud admits that the method will sometimes be wrong.

Faulty acts happen when the speaker has two conflicting intentions and one has been "forced back". 
The forced back intention returns as a slip of tongue, disturbing the other intention.
