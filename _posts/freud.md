Sigmund Freud was not just the founder of psychoanalysis, but also the first person to systematically investigate
how the mind works from a scientific perspective (or at least his understanding of science at the time).

In his book "Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis", Freud attempts to condense into a series of lectures (given around 1915) the foundations for his
theory of psychoanalysis.

Freud's theory is based on this hypothesis: mental processes (drivers of behaviour, will and thought) are unconscious, only a small fraction of them being conscious.
The distinction between "conscious" and "unconscious" here is that we have knowledge of our conscious mental processes. If you want
An empirical definition, a conscious experience can be reported, while an unconscious one can't.

The book is split into the study of 3 specific kinds of mental processes: faulty acts ("parapraxis"), dreams and neuroses.

## Faulty Acts

### intention
For Freud, faulty acts like slips of tongue provide a good model for the study of the unconscious. He thinks that these
are not chance events or symptoms of a distracted mind. 
Instead, he believes that they have a purpose or intention.
Faulty acts occur when the speaker has two conflicting intentions and one has been "forced back". 
The forced back intention returns as a slip of tongue, disturbing the other intention.

### example
One of the first examples that Freud uses is an instance where the president of the lower house of parliament says in his opening speech 
"I declare the sitting **closed**".
**Assuming** that faulty acts **do** have an intention, it's clear (just taking it literally), that he wanted to close the session.

## analysis
How can we know what is the intention of the faulty act? 
The intended meaning is clear as the speaker will always correct himself. 
The only way to know what the intention of the faulty act was is to ask the speaker. 
If he says what first comes to mind, you will have your answer. 
He might though be tempted to resist, and this will be easy to notice and will point to the path for the interpretation.


## Dreams

### intention
Just like faulty acts, dreams have a sense too.
Freud describes dreams as the mind's reaction to unwelcome stimuli that affects us during our sleep, when we ought to e completely withdrawn from any stimulus
"it is the intention of the dream-work to get rid of a mental stimulus, which is disturbing sleep, by means of the fulfilment of a wish"

### analysis
In the case of dreams as with faulty acts, we can only understand the meaning by asking the dreamer what the meaning is
In most cases, they will claim they do not know. Freud thinks though that it's probable that
> Only he does not know that he knows it and for that reason thinks he does not know it
He claims that this has been proved already in hypnosis experiments: people first deny recollection but then remember what was suggested to them under the hypnotic state
As with faulty acts, we must ask what first comes to mind in connection to the dream, or in connection with each element of the dream
From what first comes to mind, a chain of free associations will clarify what the meaning is
Often the interpretation of dreams faces a resistance, that manifests as objections to the interpretation or the technique, or withdrawal from the subject, or denial or silence. The resistance is always more interesting than the dream interpretation itself, and offers a strong hint about the meaning

### manifest vs latent
Freud distinguishes between the conscious contents of the dream - what the dreamer describes - and the unconscious contents which are inaccessible, the meaning of the dream.
The conscious content of the dream is called the manifest content, while the unconscious ideas are the latent content
The manifest content is meaningless and useless, only important insofar we can free associate from them to reach the latent content. It functions as a substitute for the unconscious ideas.
Therefore, it doesn't matter if the dream conscious contents have been further distorted by inaccuracy or memory. The important thing is not so much the minor details of each manifest dream,
but what can be learned about the latent content from free association.
The manifest content often is made of references to events that happened recently ("the day's residue"), but that's just the building blocks that the brain has to work with, and are not cogent to the latent dream.
The day's residue could even be suggestions from the therapist, thus the claim that dreamers tend to dream according to their analysts preferred theories. 
Correction: there's no latent dream and manifest dream. It's latent dream-thoughts and manifest dream-contents
And "dream" just means the sequence of images and thoughts we experience during sleep

### wish fulfulment
From dreams observed in children, he proposed that "what instigates a dream is a wish, and the fulfillment of that wish is the content of the dream".
In young children, there's is no distinction between manifest and latent, so the wish "I should like to go on the lake" instigates the dream "I am going on the lake"
Thus the connection to day-dream
Critically, the (latent) dream depicts the fulfilment of the wish, not the wish itself.
Freud reports a man who dreamt that his brother was inside a box. The latent content was that his brother was restricting himself. But the wish is not that the brother would break free, on the contrary the wish as that the brother would restrict himself more
The psychical stimuli here would be unsatisfied needs or wishes, and the satisfaction would be the wish fulfilment
How can it be that our dream's latent wishes are so different and often completely opposite to how we actually live our real lives?
Nothing in the mind forbids it to hold simultaneously locally opposite thoughts and beliefs at the same time
Often impulses originally found in childhood, like the desire to kill someone who we love
According to Freud, a small child is incapable of love, only of egotism. Because of this egotism and their need to survive, the child first needs or depends on other people, and only later learns to love them
More precisely, this death wish often manifest in children against their same sex parent. A small boy sees his father as a rival for his mother's love, and vice versa for a small girl.
This is called the "Oedipus complex": Oedipus realized the two extreme wishes - he murders his father and marries his mother.
Thus Freud identifies in childhood the origin of the latent wishes that manifest in dreams. The "evil" character of death wishes for example is then uncovered as a remain from childhood that beguiles no serious character failure
Freud asks the rhetorical question, why can't dreams be not wish fulfilment but intentions, reflections, warnings, disapproval, etc? Why only a wish fulfilment?
He expands on this saying that this question comes from confusing the latent dream-thoughts thoughts with the latent dream.
It is correct to say that the dream-thoughts can be anything, an intention, warning, reflection, an attempt at solving a problem etc
But a latent dream is "never simply an intention, or a warning, but always an intention, etc., translated into the archaic mode of thought by the help of an unconscious wish and transformed to fulfil that wish.", That is, the dream work shapes the latent dream as an expression of the latent dream thoughts in the structure of a wish fulfilment

### dream work
In adults, ideas of the latent dream are distorted (associations, disguised references and rhymes, substitutions) or obscured (mumbles, blurry memory, vagueness) in the manifest dream by a process he calls "dream censorship". 
The function of dream censorship is to
Suppress unacceptable unconscious wishes
This process that transforms the latent "dream-thoughts" into the manifest "dream-content" is the "dream work". 
"the dream-work, under the influence of dream censorship, transposes the latent dream-thoughts into [the manifest dream]" by the use of resources like...
Condensation	
    Multiple unconscious thoughts and desires with some common attribute are condensed into a single image or symbol in the dream.
Displacement
	Unconscious desires and conflicts are displaced from their original objects onto more acceptable objects in the dream.
Symbolization	
    Symbols are used to represent unconscious desires and conflicts in the dream.
Reversal
	The meanings of things in the dream can be reversed, presenting them in a way that is opposite to their usual or expected meaning.
Loss of logical relationships
	The logical or causal relationships between concepts in the dream may be disrupted, portraying events out of order or in a seemingly random way.
    The manifest content of the dream is reorganized into a more coherent narrative.

### example
a married woman was told during the day that her friend had just become engaged. She has this dream:
She was at the theatre with her husband. One side of the stalls was completely empty. Her husband tells her that her friend and her fiance wanted to go but could only get bad seats for 1.50 florins. She thought it would have been ok had they come (since there were so many empty seats)
The patient also informed two connected (real life) facts:
- the previous week she had bought theatre tickets very early and it turned out that there were lots of empty seats
- her sister had gained a present worth 150 florins and wanted to hurry to exchange it for cash, which she thought was absurd.
Freud interprets the latent dream thoughts as being:
- the patient thinks it was absurd for her to be in such a hurry to get married (from the sister's hurry, going to the play as a symbol for getting married)
- she perhaps thinks she could have gotten a husband 100 times better (the bad tickets, the price)
Dream censorship removed any allusion to "hurriedness" . The dream work substitutes "marrying too early" with "taking the theatre tickets too early" - going to the theatre means a child wish to be able to "see everything", the pleasure of looking which is only granted to married women.
Therefore the dream-thoughts of anger and dissatisfaction were transformed into the fulfillment of the wish of getting married ("going to the theatre") which has satisfied her desire in the past
The dream transformed the present negative feelings into its opposite, an old triumph over her friend for having married and finally satisfied her desire
So we see how the dream work combined an unconscious/latent wish (that to be married) with the (also unconscious) day's residue (the anger at the friend's late engagement) to produce the dream
