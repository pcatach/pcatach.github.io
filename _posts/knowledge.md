How to know anything and everything

Anything will be explainable in terms of atoms, or protons and electrons, or quarks and leptions or any other quantum fields.

Quantum field theory itself can be explained and predicted with outstanding accuracy using mathematics.

Mathematics (ignoring Godel for a while) can be completely explained from set theory, which has some axioms.

This is all straightforward, the only complication is the "human aspect". By that I mean the epistemological aspect

WHat am I? Why do I know what I know, and for what? And how do I get to know it?

Thankfully, all that can be explained by physics and maths too.

What am I?

You are a human being. You a big aggregate of cells that make up your body, but you probably think of "you" more precisly as your brain.
Your brain is an organ like others in your body - it uses up sugar and O2, produces CO2 and energy, has a high maintenance overhead, keeps
itself warm, so on and so forth. But on top of that, it has neurons that receive and send electric signals to other neurons. This mechanism
enables your brain to process sensory information as input and output actions (such as muscle contractions) in ways that we don't understand yet.

One very special thing that you/your brain are is that you are an intelligent thing. That means that you are able to able to change your own 
future (event outcomes) by virtue of your current behaviour.

Intelligence is an optimization process, a bit like evolution - it was in fact shaped by evolution to acheive correlate goes to inclusive fitness,
making you a ["mesa-optimizer"](https://www.alignmentforum.org/tag/mesa-optimization) - an adaptation executor.

Why do I know what I know, and for what?

As part of human evolution, one of the brain functions that we developed is "knowledge" - our capacity of holding beliefs (that may be true or false) and 
changing them according to our sensory inputs. You are able to hold knowledge because there is an adaptive advantage in being correct - 
correct agents increase their change of reproducing despite environmental challenges and achieve inclusive fitness. So the "reason" you know things is to be right.

How do I get to know it?

Any process of obtaining knowledge must come from some near-Bayesian process of updating priors. Bayes theorem is the mathematically proven way to reach 
correct beliefs - so if you want to win (at whatever you want to win at), you'd better be using it.

Beliefs won't be true or help you acheive your goal just by virtue of existing. Only true beliefs count, so you should always strive to hold true beliefs.
One way to keep yourself in check is to "make your beliefs pay rent":

> Any belief should restrict which experiences to anticipate, to be potentially useful and thereby pay rent and earn its keep in your mind, so to speak. 
> If a belief does not affect what you anticipate experiencing—if the world would look exactly the same whether the belief is true or 
> whether it is false—then how could you possibly tell if it were false?
> And if there's no circumstance under which you would be able to notice your belief were false, then why do you believe it now?
