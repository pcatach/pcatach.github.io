Goal: reduce, make your time more efficient, focus and live in the present

"Does this spark joy?" means that the criteria is pleasure, not need.

Tidy by category (or subcategory), not location

Spread everything in the same place (floor), ask for each item: Does this spark joy?

## Discarding

Order: clothes, books, papers, misc, mementos.

Reduce by tidying until it “clicks” and you reach just the right amount of things that you need to live comfortably.
Don't focus on reducing, focus on keeping things that bring joy

Clothes

Order: tops, bottoms, jackets, socks, underwear, bags, accessories, clothes for specific events, shoes. 
Fold into a rectangle, standing up. Arrange clothes rising to the right

Books

Put all the books on the floor. Hold one by one: do they spark joy? Divide in general and practical. 
Discard unread books. If you still haven’t read them, they have fulfilled their purpose of showing you you don't need them. 
Discarding you will be able to test your passion about the subject - if you really want to learn it, you will buy again and this time read it. The moment you first encounter a book is the right time to read it.

Papers

Dispose of all papers that are not:

- currently in use
- must be kept
- needed for a limited period of time
- must be kept indefinitely 
    - must be dealt with (store all in one place, vertical organizer) 
    - must be saved forever (store infrequently used in a folder, and frequently used in plastic pages of folder). 
    
Refrain to subdivide further. “Need attention” box ought to be empty. Lecture materials: dispose. The value of a seminar is in the lecture not in the material. If you retained the material to study later, it means you couldn't put the content in practice and it was meaningless. Manuals and warranties: discard manuals, store warranties in plastic book.

Misc

Keep things because you love them, not “just because”

CDs

Toiletries

Accessories

Valuables (passports, credit cards…)

Electronics (anything “electric”)

Household equipment (writing material, sewing kits,...)

Other (spare change…)

Hobby items

Disposables: gifts you never used, cosmetics from trips,electronic packages, unidentified cords, broken electronics, spare buttons and shoelaces, free marketing goods

Mementos

Only keep items that bring pure joy. Photos: look one by one. Only keep what brings joy - discard photos of scenery you can't even place.

## Storage

Ultimate simplicity. Designate one space for each type of item.

We avoid throwing things out for 2 reasons: we are attached to the past or afraid of the future.

Order: clothes, books, documents, misc, mementos.

Storage should reduce the effort to put things away, not to take them out. Should be able to tell at a glance where everything is.

Store bags inside each other. Empty your bag every day

## Apps

Discard what doesn't spark joy. Only keep what you really want.

Pick the 3 or 4 more important apps and leave at the home page bottom. The rest hide in a folder to never look at. Access the apps you need by the search function. After some time, open the folder to see what you really used and what can be discarded.

OR store apps in pages by category.

Turn off all notifications but messages.

Get rid of things you meant to read sometime.

Dumb down the smartphone: transform it in a tool instead of your default behaviour, make it useful but boring: cut all entertainment: set aside an usage time every day.
Leave boring utility apps in the home page, move addictive apps to a folder. 
Leave do not disturb on. Turn off lock screen notifications
