The main point of the book is that the future is not in globalisation, but in technology. 
Globalisation means repeating what already works (going from 1 to n) while technology means creating new things (0 to 1). 
Globalisation increases competition, which drives down profits and makes things closer to a zero sum game, technology does the opposite. 
Competition is "destructive" in that sense.

I do agree that (creative) monopolies are great for creating new value to humanity - 
they can afford to spend resources on improving their product, creating a culture, effecting change. 
Competitive businesses live on low margins and have a miserable existence, rarely creating anything new to society.

I do think though that competition is important to make things better for everyone (as opposed to a few people), even if it doesn't create anything drastically new.

## Why we focus on competition

The book argues that the world has seen an unprecedented period of increasing wealth and progress (50s, 60s and 80s) 
which makes western society adopt an "indefinite optimist" attitude - 
the future will be better, but we don't know how, so we won't plan for it (and thus won't build it).

In Europe we have indefinite pessimism - things will never be as good as they were, 
and we have no idea what's coming but it will be worse.

In Thiel's opinion:

> We exaggerate the differences between left-liberal egalitarianism and libertarian individualism because almost everyone shares their common indefinite attitude. 
> In philosophy, politics, and business, too, arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making concrete plans for a better future.

We attribute success to luck and circumstances - and we are suspicious of people with grand plans, 
they're either crackpots or corrupt and insincere. 
This indefinite optimism leads to the focus on competition in business.

## How to go from Zero to One

The best way to build a (creative) monopoly is to start with a small, niche market and then scale up to adjacent markets - 
like how Amazon started with rare books and eBay with beanie babies. 
If you go for 1% of a $100bi market you'll be quickly competed away.

This is the most important question that the founder of a company has to answer:

> What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

The answer to this question is necessarily a secret: a truth about the world that no one else knows. Some examples of secrets:

- Tesla: cleantech is a social phenomenon not an environmental one
- Airbnb: guests have to pay high hotel prices, property owners can't easily rent out their unoccupied space (similar for Uber, Lyft)
- Google: proprietary indexing and searching 10x better than anything else
- Apple: proprietary technology and design 10x better than anything else
- PayPal: beanie baby eBay sellers had no easy way to transfer money
- Amazon: no easy way to find rare books

We are discouraged from looking for secrets because we were taught that there are no more existing secrets: 
everything is either easy/known or impossible/unknowable.
