1. Know why you're doing a trade before you trade

2. You're never happy with the amount you traded (adverse selection)

Specialize

3. Take only the risks you're being paid to take. Hedge the others.

Self financing portfolio - account for opportunity cost

Collateral - real reason that trading costs money

Goodhart's law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

Use multiple measures of risk

Market making without an edge (buying bid and selling ask) is equivalent to selling options.

Explanation: to hedge an option you can sell when market moves up, buy when moves down (delta hedging).

Plus, hedging a long option is equivalent to selling an option.

Therefore, delta hedging without buying a long option is equivalent to selling an optio

4. Put on a risk using the most liquid instrument for that risk

5. If you can't explain your edge in five minutes, you don't have a very good one

Edge = what you know about the world and what you can do about it that the marginal trader can't

A good edge needs some, but not too much: creativity, persistence, quantitative review,

6. The model expresses the edge

7. If you think your costs are negligible relative to your edge, you're wrong about at least one of them

Costs can be understood in terms of their visibility and their linearity (how they scale)

E.g. even if a strategy/model makes a profit a majority of the times, if competition is so high that you can only get in 10% of the trades (low "hit rate"), your edge will get eaten away and adverse selection ensures you'll mostly get in the bad trades!

8. Just because something has never happened it doesn't mean it can't. 

Enough people relying on something being true makes it false

Eg. Reliance on chf euro peg, US short sale ban in 2008, reliance on low correlation within US mortgage securities as a cause for 2008 crisis

9. working to align everyone's interests is time well spent 

Hedge funds often don't have aligned interests between investors and managers: managers make more money under a high variance strategy. Even if you penalize them for losses (high water marks) it's still more worth to close shop if there are huge losses.

Same with real estate agents: it's more worth to convince a client to take a high offer than to work for months to get a better offer since the more houses they turn the better for them.

The only way to align incentives is to have the traders keep enough of their own capital in the firm, or build the pay structure to reflect this alignment.

10. If you don't master technology and data, you're losing to someone who does

11. If you’re not getting better, you’re getting worse

The goal of trading is to make sustainable profits. There is an analogy with evolution in biology.

Given a source of variation in the characteristics of organisms, which result in different reproductive fitness, natural selection is the mechanism by which less fit individuals die, and more fit (better adapted) individuals reproduce and pass on their characteristics.

The sources of variation in financial markets come in the form of new ideas, applying existing trades to new markets, combining two trades. “Reproduction” occurs in the specific ways that knowledge gets shared in financial markets: individuals learn new skills and split up and gather in new groups, just like firms split and merge.

Surviving and thriving in financial markets requires adaptation - improvement.

One of the most important sources of motivation for personal improvement, more than money and prestige, is a 6th sense about things that don't make sense, aren't quite right, “feel a bit off” or don't quite “fit”.
