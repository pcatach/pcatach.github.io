# FDA

Watchdog: CDER (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research).
Responsible for approving new drugs, both prescription and OTC.
Receives and analyses evidence tests ("clinical trials").

Manufacturers must perform laboratory, then animal, then human tests.
Lab and animal tests serve to assess the likelihood that a drug is safe and works well in humans.
The human tests determine if the drug is safe to treat a disease and provides any health benefit.

Framework for drug approval process:
- analyse the illness and available treatments - what's the threshold for success? how much risk is acceptable?
- risk-benefit analysis based on test data - is the data any good? was the experiment well designed?
- risk management strategy - is the labelling (information about risks and benefits) appropriate? Is more effort needed to mitigate risks?

In some cases, "accelerated approval" is available: promising treatments for life-threatening conditions.
The threshold for approval might lie on a "surrogate endpoint" instead of a standard clinical endpoint.
For example, let's say we're developing a drug for high blood pressure.
A clinical endpoint would be "reduction of rate of heart attacks or other cardiovascular events".
But this endpoint requires observation over several years.
A surrogate endpoint would be a reduction in blood pressure.
In such cases, expecially when an extended period of time is needed to evaluate effects, the drug maker is required to perform "post-marketing clinical trials".

The FDA assigns designations to different approaches it takes to evaluation:
- fast track - for drugs for life-threatening conditions without any existing treatment, eligible for frequent communication with the FDA
- breakthrough therapy - for drugs for life-threatening conditions with evidence that may demonstrate improvement over existing treatment, very similar to fast track, just requires different evidence
- priority review - promise to take action within **6 months instead of the standard 10 months**.

## Process

### IND

The process begins when a manufacturer/sponsor screens a new molecule for therapeutic potential and toxicity in animals, and wishes to begin test in humans.

At this point, the sponsor must submit an IND (Investigational New Drug) application.
The application is filed by a physician who will be conducting the clinical trial for an unapproved drug or an approved drug for a new condition or new patient population.

The IND application must contain:
- animal pharmacology and toxicity studies ("preclinical data") - is it safe to test in humans?
- manufacturing information - composition, stability, QA
- clinical trial design

Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 days before starting the trial.

### NDA

The data from animal studies and human clinical trials from the IND become part of the sponsor's New Drug Application (NDA).
The purpose of the NDA is to provide information so the FDA can evaluate whether the drug is safe and effective from a risk-benefit perspective, if the labelling is appropriate and if the manufacturing process is adequate.

## Clinical trials

In clinical trials (different from observational studies), patients are allocated to control and treatment groups according to experiment design criteria.
Patients in the treatment group receive an intervention and the clinical endpoint is measured after a period of time to assess the impact that the intervention had.
THe treatment group is compared to the control group using statistical methods.

- Phase I ("First in Human") - 20 to 100 people, 70% of drugs move to next stage. Used to determine safetry and dosage.
    - SAD (single ascending dose)
    - MAD (multiple ascending dose)
    - Food-effect
    - Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokynetics
- Phase II - several hundred people, 33% of drugs move to next phase. Used to determine efficacy and side effects.
- Phase III - 300 to 3000 people, 25% of drugs move to next phase. Used to determine efficacy and monitor adverse reactions.
