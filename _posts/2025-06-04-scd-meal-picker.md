I have used chatGPT to create an SCD (specific carbohydrate diet) meal/snack picker.

I have not checked that all of the suggestions are strictly SCD compliant, and I have not even checked that the code is correct.
I suppose I'm vibe coding now.

[Here](https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/6840112101188191b96a4aea90c3bdf6) is it.

By the way, a while ago I also built a map where you can click on things to get some Wikipedia information about them. [Here](https://pcatach.github.io/map/).
