**Q: Why do we need complex numbers in QM?**

Reality works in such a way that we need complex amplitudes to model phenomena.

One degree of freedom is not sufficient, we need two - otherwise we can't explain things like [Mach-Zehnder interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach%E2%80%93Zehnder_interferometer). And we need a complex product/norm because of overall phase invariance of probabilities (i.e. unitarity).

**Q: What is the configuration of a system?**

Configurations are defined by the state of every particle in a system. 
Amplitudes are assigned to configurations in QM.

Distinct configuration don't interfere. 
That's why adding a sensor - or even a nudged particle - to the MZ interferometer destroys the interference.

**Q: Why do we observe a particle to be in a single position, even though we know if is in a quantum superposition of different positions with amplitude described by a wavefunction?**

There are 3 possible answers.

1. Don't think about it
3. Our knowledge caused the collapse. 
Or something happened before our observation that caused the collapse (Copenhagen/objective collapse)
4. Many worlds

Experiments show that quantum superposition exists for macroscopic objects. If macroscopic objects can collapse, what would that mean?

> say, Earth’s wavefunction collapses around once a minute? 
> Then, while the surviving Earths at any given time would remember a long history of quantum experiments that matched the Born statistics, 
> a supermajority of those Earths would begin obtaining non-Born results from quantum experiments and then abruptly cease to exist a minute later.

If collapse were a process happening to quantum states, 
it would be the only non linear non unitary non deterministic non local Liuville theorem 
violating and CPT symmetry violating phenomenon in QM.

The decoherence (a.k.a. many-worlds) version of quantum mechanics states that measurements 
obey the same quantum-mechanical rules as all other physical processes. 
Applying these rules to macroscopic objects in exactly the same way as microscopic ones, 
we end up with observers in states of superposition.

Occam's razor says that if two theories make equivalent predictions, 
we keep the one that can be described with the shortest message, the smallest program. 
Decoherence doesn't predict anything that collapse doesn't predict, but it's a simpler theory, so the laws of probability imply that we should choose it. 
Decoherence is simpler because many worlds is a logical consequence of believing in 
the differential equations that govern wavefunction evolution.

The collapse interpretation comes from a fallacy: jumping from

> The square of this “amplitude” stuff corresponds tightly to our experimentally observed frequencies

to

> The amplitude is the probability of getting the measurement

to

> Well, obviously, once you know you didn’t get a measurement, its probability becomes zero.

Or, as put by Eliezer Yudkowski:

"This is the world where my good friend Ernest formulates his Schrödinger’s Cat thought experiment, and in this world, the thought experiment goes: ‘Hey, suppose we have a radioactive particle that enters a superposition of decaying and not decaying. Then the particle interacts with a sensor, and the sensor goes into a superposition of going off and not going off. The sensor interacts with an explosive, that goes into a superposition of exploding and not exploding; which interacts with the cat, so the cat goes into a superposition of being alive and dead. Then a human looks at the cat,’ and at this point Schrödinger stops, and goes, ‘gee, I just can’t imagine what could happen next.’ So Schrödinger shows this to everyone else, and they’re also like ‘Wow, I got no idea what could happen at this point, what an amazing paradox.’ Until finally you hear about it, and you’re like, ‘hey, maybe at thatpoint half of the superposition just vanishes, at random, faster than light,’ and everyone else is like, ‘Wow, what a great idea!’ ”
The human, looking inside the box, goes into a superposition of throwing up and being calm. The same law at all levels.

Whereas in the many worlds intepretation:

**Q: How does many worlds interpretation explain Born's rule?**

There are two questions to ask: if every outcome of a quantum experiment will manifest in some world, why do we have to assign probabilities to it? And if we do, why should they obey Born's rule?l

There's no definite answer to this question yet in the many worlds interpretation, 
but you can find a summary of the current understanding of the problem on 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#Probability_and_the_Born_rule).

As a counterpoint, one could ask the same questions — ”where do these probabilities come from?
why should they follow the Born rule, rather than some other rule?” — in any interpretation, not just in MWI.


**Q: So should we stop talking about the Copenhagen interpretation and go full Many Worlds?**

Depends. Do we we have a reason to do that? 
If you say that many-worlds should replace the immensely successful Copenhagen Interpretation, 
adding on all these twin Earths that can’t be observed, just because it sounds more reasonable and elegant — 
not because it crushed the old theory with a superior experimental prediction — then you’re undoing 
the core scientific rule that prevents people from running out and putting angels into all the theories, 
because angels are more reasonable and elegant.
