> "If human beings flourish from their inner core rather than in the realm of impact and result, 
> then the inner work of learning is fundamental to human happiness"

Zena Hitz grew up in an intellectual, atheist family. 
She became a philosophy professor pursuing her curiosity and her passion for learning, 
only to be disillusioned by the lack of touch of academia with reality and suffering of people and 
its internal power and status dynamics.

After a crisis of meaning, Hitz landed in an isolated Catholic community with life reduced to bare essentials. 
She concluded that learning is an essentially human activity, necessary for a satisfying life.

In her book “Lost in Thought”, Hitz asks fundamental questions like: is it possible and legitimate to pursue learning for its own sake? 
Is it selfish to engage in such a pursuit, given how horrible everything is and how much suffering exists? 
How do we avoid getting trapped in the allures of wealth and social status in the way of intellectual life?

Some of the main points of the book are:

- Solitary contemplation in the form of learning is a robust end goal for one’s life.
- Understanding and learning leads to human flourishing in a way that superficial spectacle-seeking doesn’t.
- Learning can't happen in mass and anonymous education, but only person to person.

This book is a full on defense of learning for learning, almost tailor made for the disillusioned academic. 
It attempts to reignite the reader’s passion for learning whether they are a university professor or what Hitz 
refers to as “the humble bookworm, the amateur naturalist, the contemplative taxi driver.”

## Learning as means and learning as end

The author distinguishes learning for its own sake from instrumental learning - motivated by outcomes. 
Through many fictional and real examples drawn from her own life, from literature and pop culture, 
Hitz argues that learning for its own sake - “Pure” learning - can be discovered after an initial period of instrumental learning.

Think of the mathematics student who enters their course thinking of becoming a quant trader and working for a big bank, 
and ends up falling in love with the wonders of topology and becomes a PhD candidate ~(only to end up at the big bank in the end nevertheless)~. 
Her point is - don't disregard unusual motivations that lead people to discover their love of learning.

She ascribes to learning for its own sake some sacred property, distinguished from the lesser forms of learning with a goal in mind. 
But can’t we learn both for intrinsic and instrumental uses?

For Hitz, no, not really. Everyone has an ultimate goal, something for which they would sacrifice anything else for, if push came to shove. 
This ultimate commitment can be displayed by one's choices - what one prioritised over what, 
as expressed by their own behaviour as opposed to their words and wishful thinking. 
What would we choose if our most basic priorities came into conflict?

## The pursuit for wealth and social status

But why bother with learning? What if I really just want to be rich? The book describes what it calls a life of futility:

> I swim for the sake of health. I want to be healthy so I can work. I work for the sake of money. 
> And money is for the sake of the food, drink, housing, recreation, and exercise - 
> all of which make it possible for me to work

For the author, becoming rich for its own sake, or “work for the sake of work” is not a worthy pursuit. 
It will not bring happiness, or if you think that this is too ambitious, it will not bring satisfaction or even alleviate pain.

But what about work for the sake of family? That’s fair game - 
contemplation can be that of the beauty of one's family, physics calculations, wood shaped into furniture, 
singing prayers, the therapist’s care for its patient.

Although learning as an end goal is an escape from the competitive and instrumental nature of our world, 
it makes possible a special kind of human connection. 
Hitz advocates for learning as a way of finding common ground with other human beings

How is that possible if we agree to see instrumental uses of learning as a hindrance? 
For Hitz, the end goal of love and connection is still understanding, and not the other way. 
And “understanding” here is not in an abstract sense. 
The contemplative exercises cited in the book are supposed to “shape our aspirations” (more on that below). 
That is, intellectual contemplation leads us to an understanding of humanity and what it means to be human that brings us together as a species. 
After all, to do mathematics, philosophy, to read literature, play music and be amazed by bugs as a child are all deeply human activities.

## Learning as escape from the world

But we see learning as a useless luxury instead of central to our happiness. 
At most, we want the magnificence of socratic thinking without his poverty. 
Some of the motivations that cloud the love for learning are the pursuit of wealth, social superiority and love of justice.

As material progress happens in a society, the intellectual life becomes more accessible, but less desirable in deference to those motivations. 
When rustic and luxury meet in society, instead of fostering intellectual life, 
they tend to conflate the lower appetites for food and sex with the higher urges for status and wealth. 
Luxurious restaurants with tiny portions, expensive holidays, sexual shame and inadequacy are just some examples.

Wealth is a tool, it cannot be a goal without destroying the other things we care about.

The academic world doesn’t escape from Hitz’s criticism. 
The academic contempt for the openly ambitious is just a desire to win the status competition on academia’s own terms.

How to escape and separate the love for learning from the pursuit of wealth and status?

The book provides the example of Augustine. He defines the concept of *curiositas*: 
seeking experience for the sake of experience and sensorial stimulation, not for improvement or understanding, 
staying at the surface. In opposition, the *studiosus* pushes for the truer, deeper meanings of things.

> Augustine described the ultimate desire of human beings as not just for truth, nor for any old pleasure, but for pleasure in the truth. Since God is truth, in God lies our happiness

But if we all strive for a life of truth, why are we not all happy? 
Encountering with truth always poses a risk - we might be challenged in what we believe, or worse, we might be asked to change who we are. 
Remaining at the surface of things and worshiping the spectacle is as far as most of us are happy to compromise.

In his personal life, Augustine was for a long time “held down” by his lust for spectacle - 
sexual deprivation, violent gladiator fights and so on. 
But through his discipline and hunger for truth he overcame his *curiositas*.

## What about social justice?

When learning has social justice as its end, it can also be corrupted. 
The concepts, languages and opinions become tools for signalling, gatekeeping and preserving a hierarchy that is not different from the one being fought against.

But how can we choose an intellectual life if there's so much to be fixed in the world?

> We step back from concerns of practical benefits, personal or public. [...] In the space of retreat we consider fundamental questions: 
> what human happiness consists in, the origins and nature of the universe, whether human beings are part of nature, 
> and whether and how a truly just community is possible.
> From the space of retreat emerges poetry, mathematics and distiller wisdom articulated in words or manifested silently in action. 
> The space of retreat is a place of escape: the prisoner, the working person, the beleaguered mother all find in
> the work of the intellect a dignity otherwise impinged on by their surroundings.

The social use of intellectual life lies in shaping our aspiration to ways of being: 
to be wise, kind, truthful, humble, resilient. Interestingly, that aspiration is not set from the beginning - 
it is found in the process of learning. The intellect provides a guide to life.

If we subjugate the intellect to economic or social goals, 
those will cloud this guide to life and establish a hierarchy of partial truths. But intellectual life is not an escape from suffering. 
It is an attempt at pursuing reality and truth at its rawest form, 
unmediated by other people’s opinions, expectations and dogmas.

As a last point in the book, Hitz notes that intellectual life has nothing to do with "knowledge" as it is commonly regarded: 
the absorption of correct opinions. Our current educational institutions traffic in correct opinions about subjects, 
learning for social and economic outcomes, and not on free inquiry and trust that students can take responsibility for their own learning. 
This just reflects the values of broader society.

The only way forward is for each and everyone of us to delve inside and discover the pleasure of a contemplative life.
