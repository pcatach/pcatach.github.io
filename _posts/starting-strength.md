# Starting strength

Properly performed, full range-of-motion barbell exercises
are essentially the functional expression of human skeletal and muscular anatomy under a
load

Squat:
Depth: Top of the patella should be above the crease of the shorts
Balance of forces between hamstrings and quadriceps
Feet shoulder width apart, 30ยบ out, get used to the way the stance looks from your point of view
Use your elbows to stretch into the correct position at the bottom.
Hips and shoulders rise at the same pace
bounce DOES NOT INVOLVE THE KNEE. Yo u bounc e off of the hamstrings and
adductors, not the quads. It happens when the hamstrings, glutes, and adductors reach the limit
of their normal range of motion
Picking up the toes is an excellent way to
learn the feel of heels-down.
Valsava manouver

Deadlift:
The back
will not pull off the floor what the hands cannot hold, due to proprioceptive feedback that tells
the back the weight is too heavy. When the grip is flipped and the hands don't slip as the load increases off the floor, the back doesn't receive the signal that makes it stop the pull.

Deadlift: 
Narrower stance, feet almost parallel, toes pointing very slightly out.
Grip bar such that thumbs clear the legs
Bend over waist, bend knees, relatively flat back
Bar should be above the middle of the feet, very close to the legs
At the top of the pull, lift your chest and pull your shoulders back
Back should be flat, but it might be necessary to slightly exaggerate  the lumbar hyperextension just to achieve the neutral position on the lift
A round lower back is bad
On the lift, first extend knees, then raise chest. Down phase is the opposite

Press:
Begins with bar at sternum height
Forearms should be vertical as seen from front or back 
Rest bar on meaty part of shoulder
Comfortable stance
Hold breath for whole movement
Lock bar up aligned with back of head/spine
On way up, slightly move your torso forward under the bar
Elbows should be In front of the bar
