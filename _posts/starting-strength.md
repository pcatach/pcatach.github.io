# Starting strength

Properly performed, full range-of-motion barbell exercises
are essentially the functional expression of human skeletal and muscular anatomy under a
load

Squat:
Depth: Top of the patella should be above the crease of the shorts
Balance of forces between hamstrings and quadriceps
Feet shoulder width apart, 30ยบ out, get used to the way the stance looks from your point of view
Use your elbows to stretch into the correct position at the bottom.
Hips and shoulders rise at the same pace
bounce DOES NOT INVOLVE THE KNEE. Yo u bounc e off of the hamstrings and
adductors, not the quads. It happens when the hamstrings, glutes, and adductors reach the limit
of their normal range of motion
Picking up the toes is an excellent way to
learn the feel of heels-down.
Valsava manouver

Deadlift:
The back
will not pull off the floor what the hands cannot hold, due to proprioceptive feedback that tells
the back the weight is too heavy. When the grip is flipped and the hands don't slip as the load increases off the floor, the back doesn't receive the signal that makes it stop the pull.
