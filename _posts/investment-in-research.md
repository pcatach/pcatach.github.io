The very definition of research is that you don't know in advance what you'll find.

- World Wide Web - created for sharing information among CERN scientists
- CRISPRâ€“Cas9 gene-editing techniques
- General realtivity and GPS
- QM and semiconductors
- Number theory and criptography
- "why a dried jellyfish glowed green when crushed" led to the discovery of GFP, which led to "leaps in understanding cancer".
- "a basic research investigation into life at high temperatures" led to advancements in DNA sequencing. This directly led to further understanding of "the evolution of HIV," earning "billions of dollars in royalties" (Leander & Whitton, 2010).

The only way to make significant advances to science is to have enough researchers and tell them to search in 
whatever direction they feel their efforts will lead to something.

Whilst an exclusive focus on application may have some merit in the short-term, there are several reasons why 
neglecting basic research is seriously flawed in the longer-term:

1. Basic and applied science are a continuum. They are inter-dependent. 
The integration of basic and applied research is crucial to problem-solving, innovation and product development. 
[Y]ou can't predict the road that science will take. 
Even if you try to only do applied sciences, fundamental research will be needed to develop new tools 
and methodologies, or else you'll just be running around in circles and never getting any new developments.

2. Skilled scientists with a good understanding of the basic theories and practice [are required for the] 
successful transfer of scientific knowledge.

3. Excessive dependency on scientific progress in other countries is rarely likely to lead to the resolution of local problems. 
Countries need to be able to generate their own scientific knowledge and adapt this to their own local context and needs.

4. The practice of science is increasingly international and the research agenda is set by those who participate. 
A country with no basic scientific research capacity effectively excludes itself from having any real influence on the future directions of science.

The concrete, unambiguous skills that students of mathematics, when properly taught, will practice and that will come in handy in their lives outside of mathematics:

1. Discussing definitions (Being able to think critically about definitions is a foundation of informed discourse.)
2. Coming up with counterexamples (healthy sense of skepticism)
3. Being wrong often and admitting it (The mathematical habit is putting your personal pride or embarrassment aside for the sake of insight.)
4. Evaluating many possible consequences of a claim
5. Teasing apart the assumptions underlying an argument
6. Scaling the ladder of abstraction (strip unimportant details, see the fundamental structure)
