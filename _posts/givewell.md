1. Malaria Consortium - SMC

Malaria kills over 400,000 people annually, mostly children under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa. 
More conservative estimate 200k.

Goal:

- distribute preventive antimalarial drugs to children 3m - 56m old, during malaria season, in countries severely 
affected by malaria (Sahel) (>10 in 100 children affected during season). Season usually lasts 4m
- four treatment courses of SP [sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine] + AQ [amodiaquine] at monthly intervals
- Provides protection up to 28 days after dose
- Target: 5.8M children reached in 2019, 12M in 2020,

Evidence:

5 RCTs “prevents approximately three quarters of all clinical malaria episodes (rate ratio 0.26; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.38; 9321 participants, six trials, high quality evidence), and a similar proportion of severe malaria episodes (rate ratio 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.76; 5964 participants, two trials, high quality evidence).”

“In house” Coverage Study Dubious methodology - survey collected by local community staff, answers are self reported by families/caregivers “93% of children received SMC during at least one monthly cycle, 81% during at least two cycles, 70% during at least three cycles, and 56% during all four cycles”

In 2019, sentinel study from national health data concluded no impact using a Random effects Poisson regression based on number of cases reported by health facilities during months with and without intervention. Malaria Consortium attributes to low quality data. Could be heavily biased by non-random comparison between areas where SMC was implemented or not

2014/15 case-control studies with parasitological confirmation of malaria infection, with controls recruited in the neighborhood of cases, controlled for confounders such as bednet use found 89% [78-95%]]efficacy (odds ratio 0.11, n~6000). Methodology was not vetted by GiveWell

Cost effectiveness

Cost per 4 person-months of SMC coverage is U$6.7 [5.8,7.8]

With a pessimistic U$5 overhead, that's U$11.7 per 4 person-months.

Neglectedness

No funding gap for 2021-2022. Gap of 44M for 2023.

This will be used to reach 1M new children in Chad and Nigeria and maintain already targeted 7M children in Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, Togo.

2. AMF - long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN)

Goal:

Provide funding for distribution of bed nets through other non-profits and govts in 7 countries in subsaharian Africa + papua new guinea

Identify funding gaps for LLIN distribution, identify partners for distribution, purchase and ship LLINs

Target: distributed 41M nets in 2019

Evidence:

Effectiveness of LLINs 22 RCTs "5.53 deaths averted per 1000 children protected per year" Significant positive impact on anemia and on enlarged spleen LLINs are widely believed by scientific community to be effective, so that new RCTs would be “deemed unethical”

Do LLINs reach recipients and remain effective Distribution from AMF seems to be the main way that people receive LLINs. LLINs last between 2 and 2.5 years, and are replaced every 3 years.

“In House” Coverage Study (“PDM - post distribution monitoring”) From 2012 to 2019 Survey of randomly selected 1.5% of targeted households to access presence, usage, condition of LLINs, Some of the data is directly inspected by surveyors (is net up), some is self-reported (was it used yesterday), Auditing suggests a low confidence on the surveys. Coverage = proportion of people living in targeted households who sleep under LLNs Reported coverage rate of 75-90% Inferred coverage rate from nets provided by AMF vs other sources: 55-87% 90% of LLINs are classified by surveyors as “viable”

What would have happened otherwise? “there were no other funders who could have closed the gaps, and nets would have been at least partially targeted at higher-risk populations while others would have been left uncovered. “

Cost Effectiveness: cost to purchase, distribute, and follow up on the distribution of an AMF-funded LLIN is $4.95. Excluding in-kind government contributions, we estimate the cost is $4.65. With overhead of $5, that's $9.7 per net.

Neglectedness:

Gap of $37M for spendings in 2022 that will be used to deliver 62M nets in 2023 in DRc, Guinea and 2 other countries.

3. Helen Keller: Vitamin A supplements

Vitamin A is important for vision and the immune system. Deficiency kills 200K children per year, more conservatively 100K. WHO defines VAD as being indicated by a serum retinol concentration lower than 0.70 μmol/L. 94 500 (54 200–146 800) deaths from diarrhoea and 11 200 (4300–20 500) deaths from measles were attributable to vitamin A deficiency in 2013, which accounted for 1·7% (1·0–2·6) of all deaths in children younger than 5 years in low-income and middle-income countries. More than 95% of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.

Goal:

Assist and fund govt run Vitamin A Supplementation in Sub-Saharian Africa

Mass Distribute VA supplements to preschool-aged children. VAS effect lasts for 6m.

Target: 10M children (in the 2nd round of 2019 distribution in Guinea, Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali).

Evidence:

Reducing child mortality 16 80s and 90s RCTs show high impact, reducing mortality by 24% [17-31%].

2004 RCT shows no impact! 1M participants, 3% decrease (-3, 11%)

The 2004 relied on self reporting and could have had much lower coverage

Methodological flaws, some of control group might have received VAS

Coverage:

It’s possible that VAD is less prevalent today, due to better diets.

Estimate is about 25-30% of preschool-aged children in the areas where the charity works, lower than the prevalence on the RCT regions (59%) “it would be very surprising if vitamin A deficiency were no longer a problem throughout sub-Saharan Africa”

VAS coverage is based on self reporting. Median coverage rate 85%

What would have happened otherwise? "Many African countries are facing funding shortfalls around VAS, and some planned VAS mass campaigns have had to be cancelled."

Cost effectiveness

Cost to deliver a vitamin A supplement through HK-supported mass distribution programs is $1.10. $6 with arbitrary $5 overhead.

Neglectedness

15M doses distributed in 2018-2019

Gap of $12.7M for spendings in the next 3 years that will be used to expand its mass distribution program to Cameroon, Kenya and additional states in Nigeria to reach at least 6.5M children.

4. Incentives for child vaccination

In Nigeria, only 43% of 1YOs received their DTP vaccine, according to WHO/UNICEF estimates.

Goal

Increase uptake of routine immunizations through conditional cash transfers (CCT) in North West Nigeria

Caregivers can receive a total of $11 over the course of five clinic visits

Target: In 2019, New Incentives enrolled approximately 90,000 children, made 380,000 disbursements, and disbursed about $820,000, which cost $2.7M.

Evidence

Relative to control households, households in the catchment area for treatment clinics were: 16 percentage points more likely to report receiving the BCG vaccination (95% CI 0.12-0.21, 63% control group mean), 21 percentage points more likely to report receiving any of the three doses of PENTA (95% CI 0.16-0.26, 54% control group mean), and 14 percentage points more likely to report any dose of measles (95% CI 0.10-0.18, control group mean 59%). Total 167 clinics participated.

Cost Effectiveness Cost to immunize one child is $47, with govt subsidize it’s $38. This includes an upwards adjustment for children who would have been immunized even without New Incentive’s CCTs.

Neglectedness

Gap of $16M to cover 700K more children than the already covered amount (500K) in 2022 and 23 in more states in Nigeria.

5. Deworming - SCI

Millions of people are infected by parasites - in 2010 ascariasis affected almost 1B people worldwide, especially in subsaharian Africa, Latin America, South Asia and Southeast Asia

Goal

Assist govt run mass distribution of deworming drugs on school-aged children in subsaharian africa (funding and delivering drugs to govts)

Target: 75% of school aged children population in targeted countries

Evidence

“We believe that there is strong evidence that administration of deworming drugs reduces worm loads but weaker evidence on the causal relationship between reducing worm loads and improved life outcomes”

Self reported coverage surveys suggest 85% of targeted children received deworming pills (median for all countries in all years).

Studies of prevalence of parasite infection in random cross-sections of children along countries over time concluded that schistosomiases prevalence decreased over time in almost all countries. There were no control groups for ethical concerns. Method of screening was urine filtration

Cost effectiveness “In general, mass deworming programs treat everyone in a targeted demographic, regardless of whether each individual is infected. Because of this, the benefits (and therefore the cost-effectiveness) of a program are highly dependent on the baseline prevalence of worm infections.“

Total cost for a schistosomiasis treatment is $1.03. SCI’s cost (minust donated drugs and govt funding) is $0.4

Neglectedness

Gap of $22.9M to expand and maintain their program from 2022 to 2024.

Other Deworming programs

Deworm the world initiative - target 20M+ children in India, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Vietnam and Pakistan gap of $2.5M

The end fund - manages grants for projects especially in subsaharian africa, target 20M+ children, they estimate $20M gap

Sightsavers- 20M+ children in 5 countries in subsaharian africa , $7.6M gap

6. Give Directly

Goal

Cash transfer to households in developing countries

Poor households are identified by their use of thatch roofs

$1000 grant delivered in two payments over several months, with an estimated $288 per capita.

Villages are selected by poverty rate, eligible households are selected and transfers are made via mobile money providers

Targeted in 2019 40K households for a total of U$33M

Evidence

RCT in western Kenya with N=1372 households found a significant increase in total non-land assets ($463 [$378 to $549]) including livestock, durable goods and savings, business expenses ($13 per month [1 to 25]), consumption ($51 per month [32 to 70]) including education and non-significant increases in health expenses ($3 per month [-1 to 6]). There was no increase in tobacco and alcohol expenses.

RCTs in Kenya exploring effects on inflation and job creation have not been vetted yet

Cost effectiveness

83% of donation is converted to cash transfer.

Neglectedness

Gap of $350M to maintain its current scale, scale up in same countries and establish programs in new countries in 2021-23
